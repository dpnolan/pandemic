__Python Ireland July 2025 Meetup__\
__Modelling the COVID Pandemic in Ireland with Python__

__Files__\
Presentation file is in Keynote, PPT and PDF
Notebooks 1 to 4 are in IPYNB and static copies in HTML
Datasets and papers used in the analysis are included here also.  

__Summary__\
The presentation will introduce common ODE models for epidemic modeling, focusing on their application and historical advocacy in Ireland. A Jupyter notebook will demonstrate a Markov Chain Monte Carlo model fitted to Irish COVID-19 data, providing insights into infection lifetimes, forecast estimates, and sensitivity analyses for Ireland. The presenter will also discuss Python libraries for this work.  

The target audience includes individuals with some Python proficiency and an interest in epidemic modeling but limited prior experience. A key objective is to identify community members who have experience with similar models during the pandemic.

Ultimately, the presentation aims to survey how data was collected, applied to decisions, and communicated, fostering a community discussion within Python and in Irish society more generally rather than simply promoting the models.
